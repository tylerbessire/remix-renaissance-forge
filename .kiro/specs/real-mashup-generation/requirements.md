# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will implement a complete AI-powered mashup generation system that takes uploaded audio files and creates professional-quality mashups using the existing Python microservices architecture. The system will orchestrate multiple services to analyze audio, calculate compatibility, generate creative concepts with Claude AI, and render final audio output.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a music producer, I want to upload 2-3 audio files and have the system automatically create a professional mashup, so that I can quickly explore creative combinations without manual audio editing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads 2-3 audio files THEN the system SHALL analyze each file for tempo, key, energy, and spectral characteristics
2. WHEN audio analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL calculate mashability scores between all song pairs
3. WHEN mashability scores are calculated THEN the system SHALL generate a creative masterplan using Claude AI
4. WHEN the masterplan is created THEN the system SHALL execute the plan by rendering the final mashup audio
5. WHEN the mashup is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a downloadable audio file with metadata

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see real-time progress updates during mashup generation, so that I understand what's happening and can estimate completion time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN mashup generation starts THEN the system SHALL display progress indicators for each major step
2. WHEN each service completes its task THEN the progress SHALL update with specific status messages
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages with actionable guidance
4. WHEN processing takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL provide estimated completion times

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a music enthusiast, I want the system to use AI to create creative and musically coherent mashup concepts, so that the results are more than just technical audio mixing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating a masterplan THEN Claude AI SHALL analyze the musical characteristics of input songs
2. WHEN creating the concept THEN the AI SHALL generate creative titles, artistic vision, and detailed timeline
3. WHEN planning the mashup THEN the AI SHALL specify exact timing, effects, and production techniques
4. WHEN problems are identified THEN the AI SHALL provide specific solutions for musical conflicts

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle audio processing errors gracefully, so that I can understand what went wrong and try again with different inputs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN audio files are invalid or corrupted THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
2. WHEN services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff
3. WHEN processing fails THEN the system SHALL clean up temporary files and reset state
4. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide offline-friendly error handling

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to properly orchestrate all existing microservices, so that each service can focus on its specific responsibility.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN mashup generation starts THEN the system SHALL call the analysis service for each audio file
2. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL call the scoring service for compatibility calculation
3. WHEN scores are ready THEN the system SHALL call the orchestrator service for masterplan creation
4. WHEN the masterplan exists THEN the system SHALL call the processing service for audio rendering
5. WHEN stems are needed THEN the system SHALL call the separation service as required

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the generated mashup to include detailed metadata and timeline information, so that I can understand the creative decisions and potentially make modifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a mashup is generated THEN the system SHALL include the AI-generated concept description
2. WHEN the mashup is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a detailed timeline with timestamps
3. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL show which stems and effects were used in each section
4. WHEN problems were solved THEN the system SHALL document the AI's creative solutions
